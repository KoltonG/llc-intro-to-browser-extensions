        #What is a browser extension?

        Browser extensions are small pieces of code that make your web browsing experience more fun, more useful, more private or more public. 
        
        ![](framework/img/workshop/extensionExamples.png)
        
        They usually show themselves as buttons in the top bar of your web browser and allow some extra functionality that doesn't come with your browser by default.

        #The folder is the trick

        Note that when you add an unpacked extension to your Chrome, you have to select the WHOLE folder, not just a file inside of it. 

        When you add a new unpacked extension, Chrome looks for the manifest file to see what's inside and what it should do next.

        The basics of a browser extension are pretty straight forward. All we have to kick things off are a folder of images, and a file called manifest.json.

        # The Manifest file

        The manifest file is going to come up a lot in this workshop. It's the backbone of everything that your extension is and does. The manifest is where you can set the title and description, icons and all of those fancy details. But it's also where you can ask people using your extension for special permissions to control web pages. 

        You have a basic manifest file in your exercises folder already. You can open that and see what's inside now.

    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Exercise (5-10 minutes)

        Because Chrome is paying attention to the manifest file first, the manifest file is what we can start playing with first. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the manifest. 

        Can you change the name of your extension, change the version number, change the description? Each time you save your file, hit "refresh" on the extension in Chrome and see it change right away. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Changing the icon of your extension

        Software has icons. This we know. We double-click on so many icons it's become a default behaviour for all computers everywhere. So browser extensions can also have icons. 

        Let's add one. 

        Change your manifest file to include an "icons" parameter.

        ```javascript
{
  "name": "Getting Started Example",
  "version": "2.0",
  "description": "First project to build a fresh chrome extension",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/get_started16.png",
    "32": "images/get_started32.png",
    "48": "images/get_started48.png",
    "128": "images/get_started128.png"
  }
}
        ```
        
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Changing the icon

        Because people arrive at your extension on different devices, you need to provide a few different sizes of your icons. 

        Hint: You can find some stand-in icons in the project folder that you are free to use. If you're familiar with photo editing software like Photoshop, you can also make your own.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Errors (handling them)

        Sometimes you'll get an error when you try to refresh your extension. That might look like this:

        ![](framework/img/workshop/extension_load_error.png)

        The good news it's very clear about what's broken, showing you which line number it's on, which column (how many letters in) and in which file. This makes it much easier to go in and fix it. When you're done, click "retry" to give it another shot.

        This is what we call a "Hello World" moment: Proof that the basic idea works. Now we can start building on it. 

        So let's look at next steps: Making it actually do something.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Give it a button
        
        The biggest thing about browser extensions that most people are familiar with is they come with a button. 

        Buttons trigger actions. 

        But what the button looks like, and what the button triggers, that's all defined in the manifest. It looks a little like this:

        ```javascript
"page_action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "images/get_started16.png",
      "32": "images/get_started32.png",
      "48": "images/get_started48.png",
      "128": "images/get_started128.png"
    }
}
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide centered" data-markdown data-toc>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Press the button

        ![](framework/img/workshop/pressbutton.gif)

        Buttons are really fun. We should make our button do something. 
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # First we need permission
        
        The internet being what it is, and consent being a proper requirement to run our code in other people's web browsers, permissions are a big part of writing extensions. 

        Permissions also live in the manifest file. 

        ```javascript
        "permissions": ["activeTab"],
        ```

        This gives our extension permission to access the current tab that you're working in, edit it, manage it, even close it. 

      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Next: A script!
        
        A script is the list of commands that will run in your browser when you click the button. The manifest can point to them so everything ties together very cleanly. 

        Referencing a script file looks something like this:

        ```javascript
        "background": {
          "scripts": ["script.js"],
          "persistent": false
        }

        ```

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Checking in
        
        Overall your whole manifest file should look like this.

        ```javascript
{
    "name": "My first beautiful extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "First project to build a fresh chrome extension",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "permissions": ["activeTab"],

    },
    "page_action": {
      "default_icon": {
        "16": "images/get_started16.png",
        "32": "images/get_started32.png",
        "48": "images/get_started48.png",
        "128": "images/get_started128.png"

    },

        #The script
        
        We added a reference to something called script.js in our manifest file. 

        Now it's time to create that file. 

        Open a blank file in your text editor and save it as script.js. 

        This script.js file is going to include commands to manipulate any web page we come across. 
      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Make your script listen to your button

        This is the big part: Linking your button to your script. 

        In you script.js file:

        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener()
        ```

        This is a bit of a mouthful so let's look at it 

        - chrome is the browser<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - pageAction is the button \(Remember the pageAction part of our manifest? It's looking there\)<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - onClicked is the wait. Don't run the script right away, wait until we click on the button<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        - addListener is the command. When we click, do this:<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Make your script listen to your button

        It's verbose, that's for sure. Here's the next part:

        ```javascript
function() {}
        ```
        A function is essentially a command, or series of commands, to run on demand. This part sits in between the parentheses for the previous part. It's what will be triggered as soon as you press the button. 

        Together, they look like this: 

        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener( function() {} );
        ```

        The portion in between the curly braces  {}  is where we focus our attention now. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Adding functionality to your script

        This is the part where we use the "active tab" permission we put in our manifest earlier. 

        ```javascript
chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) { } )
        ```

        Chrome first goes to the active window you have open right now, then the active tab you have open right now. 

        Once it finds that active tab, it can run some code in it. That's another function.

        We call these "nested functions" because they sit inside of each other and rely on each other. But they sure make for some confusing reading. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        All together, your script file should look like this: <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        
        ```javascript
chrome.pageAction.onClicked.addListener( function() {
  chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) { } )
});
        ```
        <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->


      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Adding functionality to your script

        Now we go one more layer deeper into the matrix. 

        Take a deep breath. 

        Here we go. 

        Inside our latest set of curly braces ( {} ) add this little bit:

        ```javascript
chrome.tabs.executeScript(
  tabs[0].id,
  {code:  'document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";' }
);
        ```

        Breaking it down

        * chrome is the browser <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * tabs is the active tab that we isolated in the previous step <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * code is what you're going to execute inside of that tab <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * document.body... is JavaScript and that's what you are sending into the tab to run on the page <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide centered" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #That's right

        ![](framework/img/workshop/unimpressed.gif)

        All of those steps until now have allowed us to run one line of JavaScript on the page loaded into our tab:

        ```javascript
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Give it a shot

        Load up a variety of pages. Tap the button you made. Watch the background colour of those pages change before your eyes. 

        But this is the power you now have: This is just one way to edit these pages. 

        Now that you have the button set up, you can tell it to edit these pages in any way you see fit. You have all of the power.

        With a lot of code, we end up doing a lot of setup work to make our actual construction work a lot easier. This is one of those situations. 

        Up until now we've been setting up our extension to: 

        * exist in our extensions with our own title and description<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * have permission to identify and manage our tabs<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        * have a button with our logo of choice on it<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        This raises some necessary ethical questions:

        #Some background

        If we're going to spend our afternoon editing web pages, we should understand a bit of what web pages are built with.

        HTML. 

        It all comes back to HTML.

        #The basic idea of HTML

        HTML is written in tags. 
        
        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser.
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>

        #Nested tags

        Tags can be *nested* within other tags like this:

        ```
        <outertag>outer content <innertag>inner content</innertag> outer content</outertag>
        ```

        Nested tags create a family tree-like relationship, often referred to as *parent* and *child* nodes.
        
        The inner tag is the child of the outer tag.
        
        ```
        <parent>

        # Attributes in images
        
        Images, the focus of our work today, have one really really import attribute.

        The `src` attribute is used to identify which image we're loading into the page.

        ```
        <img src="images/picture.jpg">
        ```

        An ```img``` tag by itself doesn't do much until you tell it what image file to load. Once it knows what image you want to use, though, then it becomes powerful.

        Back to our extension, sitting inside our very lovely script.js file: 

        We want to have even more fun with our extension. But that's going to be hard if we have to write every single line of code inside quotation marks like that. 

        Let's do better.

        In your script file, instead of this line: 

        ```javascript
        code: 'document.body.style....'
        ```

        Try something like this: 

        ```javascript
        file: 'main.js'
        ```

        That's right: Instead of writing code awkwardly in that spot buried down deep inside functions, you can just tell it to run everything that is inside a separate file. 

        Let's do that.

        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
        ```

        If you save everything and hit refresh on your extension, it will do the exact same thing as before. But now it's a lot easier to work with.

        Instead of changing the background colour, let's do something a little more dramatic. 

        ```javascript

        # JavaScript variables

        Variables are a thing in almost all programming languages ever. 

        They are kind of like containers, or a box.

        * used to *store* values
        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a *name* to a *value*.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address.  Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

        The value `Hello` is given to the name `myVariable` and is declared using the keyword `var`. This is *assigning* a value to the *variable*.

        Coming back to our browser extension: We can use these tools that JavaScript offers us to look at any page and manipulate it.

        ```javascript
        var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
        ```

        This creates a variable that stores a list of every image on the page, which we can take a look at individually in something called The Console.

        #Accessing the Console

        You can open the console when viewing _any_ HTML page. In Chrome, there are different ways to open the Console tab.

        Keyboard shortcut:
        `COMMAND + OPTION + J` (MAC)  / `CONTROL + SHIFT + J` (WINDOWS)

        OR

        Select: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.

        Open the console in this slide presentation. Take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.

        ---

        ###Pro tip!
        The console also shows any errors on the page so if you open the console on any existing web page, you *may* see some error messages.

        ```javascript
        var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
        console.log(allImages);
        ```

        Now refresh and run your extension: You'll see something new being injected into the console. It's a list of every image on the page. Hover your mouse over each of them and it will even show you which image on the page that one is.

        ```
        <img alt="" src="http://placekitten.com/100/100">
        ```

        Unlike a lot of tags, ```img``` tags don't have a closing ```</img>``` at their close.

        That little src= is the source attribute, linking the image tag to the actual image file.

        There is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to change the attribute of an HTML element on the page. 

        Conveniently enough, it's called setAttribute. Here's an example:

        ```javascript
        image.setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300')
        ```

        # Loops

        Humans are really bad at repetitive tasks. Repetitive tasks are also really boring. 

        Computers are good at boring repetitive things! We call them loops. 

        Essentially, we can take a whole list of things (like a list of images, for example...) and then run the same bit of code on each item. 

        Loops become very powerful very quickly.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Loops!

        What it means for us right now: We can loop through all of the images on the page and change each of them to be the image we want.  

        That loop looks a bit like this: 
        ```javascript
var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
console.log(allImages);
for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
  console.log(allImages[i]);
}
        ```

        Let's break that down: 

        * allImages is a variable that conains a list of all the images on the page. 
        * i is a variable that tracks which of the images in the list we're currently working with. It's a number that walks up the list of images with us, starting at 0. 
        * So i starts at 0, goes until it's reached the length of all the images, increasing by one every time. 
        * At each image, it console.logs that image. 

      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Loops!

        Loops are difficult to read. There's a lot of punctuation in them and a lot of curly braces and a they're weird looking. No worries. 

        Whenever you see: 

        ```javascript
        allImages[i]
        ```

        That just means this is one of the images on the page, the image we currently care about, the image that we are about to change. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Replacing the images

        Now that we have the allImages[i] that represents the image we want to change, we can add a line of javascript in our loop that looks like this:  

        ```javascript
        allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/200/300');
        ```

        That will take the src attribute of the image and replace whatever is currently there with a placekitten link. 

        Go ahead. Give it a try. Load up any page and place some kittens (or puppies or bears or Bill Murray). 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there
        
        The placeholder image links have a /200/300 in them. Those are the width and height of the image they're going to put in place. 

        So instead of using the same 200x300 image for every image on our page, we can use the appropriately sized image each time. 

        To do this, we need to detect how big the original image in that spot was. 

        ```javascript
var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
        ```
        Those two lines create two new variables, and use the clientHeight and clientWidth attributes to store how big the original images are. 
        

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there
        
        Then we can string together those new height and width values into the placeholder image link to tie it all together. 

        ```javascript
allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight)

        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Different images here and there
        
        Altogether now, this is how that loop ought to look (approximately): 

        ```javascript
var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');

for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
  var imageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
  var imageWidth = allImages[i].clientWidth;
  allImages[i].setAttribute('src', 'http://placekitten.com/' + imageWidth + '/' + imageHeight)
}
        ```

        # Add some more fun

document.body.style = "transition: 2s; transform: rotate(1080deg);";
