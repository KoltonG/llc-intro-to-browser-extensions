				#Stretch goals

				Whoa! You either finished early or you're back for more
				
				![](framework/img/workshop/stretch.gif)

				Let's do this
			</script>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Streeeeeeeetch

				Applying your transitions to the entire page at once is pretty fun. But it's more fun to control which images get your magic touch. 

				Let's make that our next feature. 
				 
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Event listeners

				Events are very common in web development. Events are how a web browser interprets what happens when someone clicks their mouse, or scrolls down the page, or finishes loading a page, or hovers over an image on a page. There are literally hundreds of events firing from your web browser every second. 

				Event *listeners* are small pieces of code that pay attention to those events. 

				Event listeners can be very powerful. 

			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Event listeners
				
				Event listeners are generally attached to elements that are already on your page. That way you can say "hey, image, when someone clicks on you, this is how you should behave." In that case, we attach an event listener to that image. 

				Luckily for us, our previous work on this extension has already allowed us to gather images. We have a line that reads: 				

				```javascript
				var allImages = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
				```

				Then we have another line inside our loop over images that reads:
				
				```javascript
				var thisImageHeight = allImages[i].clientHeight;
				```

			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Event listeners
				
				Remember that ```allImages[i]``` means this particular image in our loop. 

				So instead of updating it immediately with our new picture, we can tell it to wait until someone clicks on it. 

				```javascript
				allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
					console.log(this)
				})
				```

				Let's go over each part: 

				- ```allImages[i]``` is the particular image on the page. 
				- ```addEventListener``` is telling that image to pay attention to an event
				- ```'click'``` tells it what event to pay attention to. It's going to wait for someone to click on it.
				- ```function() {}``` is what happens when someone does click on it. The code to execute when someone clicks on that image goes in between the curly braces.

			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Wait - what's THIS
				
				```javascript
					console.log(this)
				```

				That's weird. 

				The word ```this``` just refers to the item you just clicked on. What did you just click on? This. I just clicked on this: I'm going to console.log() it. 

				It's weird to just have one word "this" but it's actually a very powerful tool in our tool box.

			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Event listeners
				
				The code right now should look like this: 

				```javascript
				for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
				    allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
						console.log(this)
					})
				}
				```

				Since we have ```this``` we can also act on it just as we did with our previous exercise. 

				```
				var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
				var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
				var imageLink = "http://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
				this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
				```

			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Stretch goal the first
				
				All together now, your click-to-replace-image code will be: 

				```javascript
				for (var i = 0; i < allImages.length; i++) {
					allImages[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
						var thisImageHeight = this.clientHeight;
						var thisImageWidth = this.clientWidth;
						var imageLink = "http://placekitten.com/" + thisImageWidth + "/" + thisImageHeight;
						this.setAttribute('src', imageLink);
					})
				}
				```
				
				MAGIC!

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Return of the stretch
				
				Now that we know how to act on individual elements on the page, we can have a little bit of fun with ```this``` in other ways, too. 

				Like, we can make them disappear. 

				Taken five minutes and see if you can come up with the two different ways we could remove an element from the page. 				
				
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Stretch to the solution

				First up, we have to select every text element or image element on the page.

				```
				var myElementsToDisappear = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
				```

				Note: You could use ```p``` tags or any other kind of tag in this exercise. The world is your oyster. 				

				
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Stretch to the solution

				Loop through them and add your click event listener to them, same as before. 

				```
				for (var i = 0; i < myElementsToDisappear.length; i++) {
					myElementsToDisappear[i].addEventListener('click', function() {
						
					})
				}
				```
				
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Stretch to the solution

				From here there are a couple of different ways you can proceed. 

				(One of the fun parts about working in code is there are always many different ways to solve a problem: The correct solution is the one that makes sense to you.)

				You can either hide the element from view, or you can delete it entirely from the page. 
				
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Hiding from view

				Hiding something from view is a style question. We're making something invisible. Again, there are two ways to approach this task: 

				- Changing its opacity. 
				- Changing if it's rendered.

				Option 1: 
				```
				this.setAttribute('style', 'opacity: 0')
				```

				Option 2:
				```
				this.setAttribute('style', 'visibility: hidden')
				```
				
			</script>
		</section>

		<section class="slide" data-markdown>
			<script type="text/template">
				#Removing it entirely

				Removing an element from the page entirely is a permanent move. Hiding it from view? That can be undone. Deleting it? Not so much. 

				Removing it from view is also a much simpler proposal: 

				```
				this.remove()
				```

				Boom. Done. Gone.
